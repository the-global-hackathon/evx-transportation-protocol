Use cases for places search
As an Alexa application developer, you may want to integrate a places search if you are building:

- A restaurant reviewing application. Users can search for nearby restaurants and then write reviews about the restaurant.
- A ridesharing application. A place can serve as an origin or destination point for the trip.
- A tour guide application. The virtual tour guide can suggest landmarks to visit in the user's area.

### What is the Geocoder API?
The Geocoder REST API enables developers to convert street addresses to geo-coordinates and vice-versa with forward geocoding, including landmarks, and reverse geocoding.

The HERE Geocoder API is a REST API that allows you to:

* Obtain coordinates for addresses
* Obtain addresses or administrative areas for locations
* Obtain coordinates for known landmarks.

### What is the Places API?
The Places (Search) API is a REST API that allows you to build applications where users can search for places and receive detailed information about selected places.

What you'll need
* a HERE Developer account from the AWS Marketplace for leveraging location APIs
* an Amazon Web Services account to host your project code
* an Amazon Alexa Developer account to configure your Alexa Skill
